PkgTool
=======

Python package project management.


To pip install a package developed using pkgtool, you will need pkgtool installed.
This is because the setuptools.setup arguments are generated by pkgtool.
I would like to find a way around this or perhaps add pkgtool to the setup_requires argument.
